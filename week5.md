# Week 5

## [Home](https://dtxiong.github.io/rapid-prototyping/)

We only met together one time this week because of the break. 

We first had a guest presentation from Prof. Rea Lavi on systems thinking. We applied systems thinking procedure to the energy collection portion of our solar cooking project, which including analyzing the system architecture, function, and outcomes. In particular, to improve the design we could additionally make the focusing element such that it's aesthetically pleasing and/or collapsable to minimize its negative visual impact on the space when not in use.

We discussed the details of our light-focusing apparatus. We chose to use mirrors instead of a lens. The mirror can be made using mylar. The mylar can be easily formed into a parabolic shape by attaching the mylar to a circular box and introducing a vacuum in the box, as shown [in this video](https://youtu.be/8CLRTa_ocmo). Overtime, the mylar will stretch into a parabola, which is good at focusing light rays into a focus point. We will purchase some mylar to try to make a prototype of our mirror. 

The light should be defocused to cover the collection area. This way, we do not burn a hole into the collection area. However, it needs to be focused enough to reach high temperatures. Thus, the collection surface should not be at the focus point, but a bit closer or farther away. With this, the light will focus onto a small circle on the collection area, which will have the highest temperature. The temperature outside of the circle will fall with a -ln(r) dependence. The equilibrium temperatures will depend on the rates of convection with the air around it. More heat will be convected away if the air outside is colder, so the equilibrium temperature will be smaller. 

For flat-plate collectors, there are generally 2 parts: a black plate for absorbing and a transparent cover. A common absorber coating used is black enamel paint. We can analyze the emmisivity constants for multiple materials:
- Black Silicone Paint: 0.93
- Black Epoxy Paint: 0.89
- Black Enamel Paint: 0.80

Glass is also used over the collection surface which will act like a greenhouse, because it is an insulator. The panels will be surrounded on the other sides by insulating material, so heat does not leak out the sides. 

The temperature reached by the collection area must be higher than the temperature wanted to cook the meals because of the 2nd law of thermodynamics. This is very hard to reach. 

More communication is needed with the energy storage team on how the energy will be transferred from the collection surface. Will the salts be moving the heat around using convection? We will need to calculate the efficiencies of these.
