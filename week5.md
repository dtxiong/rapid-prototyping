# Week 5

## [Home](https://dtxiong.github.io/rapid-prototyping/)

We only met together one time this week because of the break. 

We first had a guest presentation from Prof. Rea Lavi on systems thinking. We applied systems thinking procedure to the energy collection portion of our solar cooking project, which including analyzing the system architecture, function, and outcomes. In particular, to improve the design we could additionally make the focusing element such that it's aesthetically pleasing and/or collapsable to minimize its negative visual impact on the space when not in use.

Mylar sheets for making parabolic mirrors. We will purchase some to try to make a prototype of our mirror. 
The parabola can be created easily by attaching the mylar to a circular box, then introducing a vacuum in the box. Overtime, a parabola will form.

The light should be defocused to cover the collection area. This way, we do not burn a hole into the collection area. However, it needs to be focused enough to reach high temperatures. 

Look into energy/heat transfer. At focus or near focus, can assume the angle is near normal. Bidirectional reflectance?
