Guest Presentation on 

Mylar sheets for making parabolic mirrors. We will purchase some to try to make a prototype of our mirror. 
The parabola can be created easily by attaching the mylar to a circular box, then introducing a vacuum in the box. Overtime, a parabola will form.

The light should be defocused to cover the collection area. This way, we do not burn a hole into the collection area. However, it needs to be focused enough to reach high temperatures. 

Look into energy/heat transfer. At focus or near focus, can assume the angle is near normal. Bidirectional reflectance?
