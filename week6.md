# Week 6

## [Home](https://dtxiong.github.io/rapid-prototyping/)

This week, as part of the energy capture team, we started making some prototypes. 

We first tried using Mylar to create a parabolic mirror. We stretched the mylar over the vacuum pot, and used a pump to remove the air from the pot. Though we tried multiple times, we could not get the Mylar to be sealed completely. We first tried using double sided tape, then also tried to wrap duct tape around it. The vacuum would not hold for long in the pot, and the air would be let out. In addition, when the vacuum was introduced the Mylar would produce waves along the edges due to stretching. 

Pictures are shown here:

Because this did not work, we went to a different offer. The problem came from having the mylar stretched radially. Instead, we can produce many smaller squares with mylar streched over them. When we put the squares together, we can angle them to be able to reflect the light in the proper direction, similar to the parabolic mirror. These squares have a plastic base, which we used a laser cutter to create. Pictures of the laser cutting procedue is shown here:
