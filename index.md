### Project Overview

Goal: Design an intervention that captures energy from the environment, and use it.

Working as a team, we will create a single project to meet the reuqirements in the duration of the Fall term. 
It will accomplish one or more of the following:
- As a didactic tool to demonstrate to the public some principles related to sustainability and renewable resources
- To accomplish a task normally accomplished with traditional forms of energy
- Capture and utilize the energy in a novel manner beneficial to humanity

### Precedent 

The contraption must first be able to harness energy. This can take place in many forms:
- Solar
- Wind
- Chemical
- Gravitational

Here are a few examples:
1. On campus, there are solar garbage cans, which use the energy it obtains to compact the garbage. https://bigbelly.com/
2. Wind powered water pump. https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Wind-Powered-Water-Pump/
