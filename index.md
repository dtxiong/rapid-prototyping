# 22.03: Rapid-Prototyping
## David Xiong


### Bio
I am a junior undergraduate student at MIT double majoring in Nuclear Science and Engineering, and Physics. I'm interested in fusion energy, and Tokamak design. On campus, I play in a cello ensemble and help show movies with the MIT Lecture Series Committee. I'm originally from central New Jersey.

### Project Overview

Goal: Design an intervention that captures energy from the environment, and use it.

Working as a team, we will create a single project to meet the reuqirements in the duration of the Fall term. 
It will accomplish one or more of the following:
- As a didactic tool to demonstrate to the public some principles related to sustainability and renewable resources
- To accomplish a task normally accomplished with traditional forms of energy
- Capture and utilize the energy in a novel manner beneficial to humanity

### Precedent 

The contraption must first be able to harness energy. This can take place in many forms:
- Solar
- Wind
- Chemical
- Gravitational

Here are a few examples:
1. On campus, there are solar garbage cans, which use the energy it obtains to compact the garbage. https://bigbelly.com/
2. Wind powered water pump. https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Wind-Powered-Water-Pump/


### Week 2

#### Potential Projects:
Eco-Bikes: Use regenerative braking, but might not be very efficient. Use solar panels to charge phone, from the bike. 

Solar panel hat. A hat will have solar panels on it to collect energy to charge the phone. However, might be clunky to use. 

There are methods to capture water from the air. This could be used in Saudi Arabia and other countries where water is more scarce. 

Solar powered public infrastructure, including vending machines, water fountains, ATMs etc.

Compost heat generators

Using sewer flow or trash from public bins or algae â†’ hydroelectric and biofuel: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809917300875

Outdoor pavilion powered by solar energy that delivers energy to create hot water. This could be used for coffee, tea, etc.
