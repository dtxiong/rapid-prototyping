Worked with Pablo. He will help. We will try to create a fiberglass layup composite of the mylar parabolic mirror, like this video:

PVC plate - smooth, 

Need safety tests/checks?

Actually, this mylar sheet will be a catenoid, not a parabola. However, it will be close enough (taylor approx of cosh is similar to parabola)

The dimensions calculated by the sytem integration team are:

One idea was to have a flat mirror at halfway. However, this is a very large secondary mirror, will take up half the area. This will lose 25% power from the rays. 

Another idea: Have one way mirror? Optimize this: show calculations. 
If the area of the primary mirror is larger than twice the area of the secondary mirror, then have 100% reflection. 

Calculations of focal poits, secondary mirror
Consider 30 in. diameter primary mirror, 3 in height.
