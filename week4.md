### Energy Capture

Our end goal is to determine a method to cook food and heat water using solar energy. One possible method will directly heat the food/pan using solar rays which are passed through a lens or reflected by a mirror. Another method would be to indirectly heat the food and water by converting the power into electricity first, then using the electricity to heat the water and food. 

This week, we did research in preparation for the pin-up, where we presented our thoughts to the other groups.  


There are several options for focusing light rays to directly heat the food and water: Parabolic mirror, Spherical Mirror, Fresnel Lens

Advantages of using a reflector instead of fresnel lens: will get all the wavelengths. 
Solar power up to 1000 W/m^2. On average over a day, about 150 W/m^2. 

Look into absorptive surfaces. emmisivity+absorptivity+reflectivity = 1. Find what is the optimal? Insulate the back side. If there is a cloud covering the solar panel/night time, could also cover the top, to reduce emmisivity. 

How to track the sun? Maybe don't have to, and just have it be manual, based on when it is being used. There are open source libraries online to help track the sun. 

Solar power vs time of day:

Tracking will help about 50 W at peak hours, 100 W before and after. The tracking does not need to be too accurate, because of the cosine dependence -- 5 degrees of offset will still capture 99.6% energy. 


How much would a solar panel cost? Mirror? Lens? 

How to create an array of lens? Focal length becomes limited factor, as they can't all focus. 

Fresnel Lens - will focus light from the sun into a single point, at its focal point. Large focal length often gets a wider focus area, smaller gets a tighter focus area. 
We do not want a very small focus area -- could lose some power due to radiative heat losses which go as T^4. 


After the sun is down, will there be cooking? Is anyone doing midday cooking? Might need to store enough energy for later. Separating the solar cooking surface from the collection surface would allow for more flexibility. 

What will the collection surface be? What is the aimed temperature? Energy storage team wants 450 degrees celsius for their storage salt (that's a lot!).
