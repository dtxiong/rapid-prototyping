### Energy Capture

Advantages of using a reflector instead of fresnel lens: will get all the wavelengths. 
Solar power up to 1000 W/m^2. On average over a day, about 150 W/m^2. 

Look into absorptive surfaces. emmisivity+absorptivity+reflectivity = 1. Find what is the optimal? Insulate the back side. If there is a cloud covering the solar panel/night time, could also cover the top, to reduce emmisivity. 

How to track the sun? Maybe don't have to, and just have it be manual, based on when it is being used. There are open source libraries online to help track the sun. 

How much would a solar panel cost? Mirror? Lens? 

How to create an array of lens? Focal length becomes limited factor, as they can't all focus. 

Fresnel Lens - will focus light from the sun into a single point, at its focal point. Large focal length often gets a wider focus area, smaller gets a tighter focus area. 
We do not want a very small focus area -- could lose some power due to radiative heat losses which go as T^4.
