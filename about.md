### Bio
I am a junior undergraduate student at MIT double majoring in Nuclear Science and Engineering, and Physics. I'm interested in fusion energy, and Tokamak design. On campus, I play in a cello ensemble and help show movies with the MIT Lecture Series Committee. I'm originally from central New Jersey.
