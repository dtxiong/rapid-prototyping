### Week 3

#### Energy Collection methods
Possible energy collection methods:
- Solar panels
- Rain water collection
- Wind turbine 
- Piezoelectric (Platforms that collect energy from steps)

Solar panels and Wind turbines are established sources, and provide decent power. Rain water collection does not collect that much power, though it may be possible to use a large area (the ceiling of MIT main building). Piezoelectric provides the least energy.
