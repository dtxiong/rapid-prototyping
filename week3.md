### Week 3

We organized into 3 groups: Energy collection, storage, usage. I joined the energy collection team, and we discussed the different possible ways to capture energy. 

#### Energy Collection methods
Possible energy collection methods:
- Solar panels
- Rain water collection
- Wind turbine 
- Piezoelectric (Platforms that collect energy from steps)

Joseph calculated the power density of these various energy sources. 

Given a 2 square meter area, the energy source will produce:

Solar: 1.28 kW

Walking: 28.2 W

Wind: 27.4 W

Rain: 42 mW

As can be seen, Solar panels are by far the best, and are already a well established source of energy. Wind turbines are also an established source, but will not work well in a small space, as it needs large arms, and wind capture is better at higher heights. Piezoelectric provides some energy, though not enough to power a gazebo with light and heating. Rain water collection collects very little power, though it may be possible to use a large area (the ceiling of MIT main building). The water collected can also be used as a source itself. 

On the second day, Brian Telfer, a Lincoln Lab engineer, presented on energy harvesting. We also decided on a project idea. 

The project will have the broader idea of using renewable energy to cook food, heat water, or other similar applications. 

We also developed research questions:

- Have there been other attempts at renewable, on-demand cooking? 
   - A company called Sun Buckets has developed a similar device that uses phase changing salt to store heat
- What temperature ranges are useful? 
   - Residential uses cap out around 500F, also depends on the cooking technique
- What are different materials to store heat?   
   - A: Water, solids, salt, wax
