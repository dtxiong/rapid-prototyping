### Week 3

We organized into 3 groups: Energy collection, storage, usage. I joined the energy collection team, and we discussed the different possible ways to capture energy. 

#### Energy Collection methods
Possible energy collection methods:
- Solar panels
- Rain water collection
- Wind turbine 
- Piezoelectric (Platforms that collect energy from steps)

Joseph calculated the power density of these various energy sources. 

Given a 2 square meter area, the energy source will produce:

Solar: 1.28 kW

Walking: 28.2 W

Wind: 27.4 W

Rain: 42 mW

As can be seen, Solar panels are by far the best, and are already a well established source of energy. Wind turbines are also an established source, but will not work well in a small space, as it needs large arms, and wind capture is better at higher heights. Piezoelectric provides some energy, though not enough to power a gazebo with light and heating. Rain water collection collects very little power, though it may be possible to use a large area (the ceiling of MIT main building). The water collected can also be used as a source itself. 

On the second day, Brian Telfer, a Lincoln Lab engineer, presented on energy harvesting.
