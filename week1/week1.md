### Intro to Prototyping

In the first week, we created a phone case using a sponge. The case was designed such that the sponge had a cutout for the phone. There was a top and bottom sponge, and the top sponge could be lifted like a wallet case. 


### Project Precedent 

The contraption must first be able to harness energy. This can take place in many forms:
- Solar
- Wind
- Chemical
- Gravitational

Here are a few examples:
1. On campus, there are solar garbage cans, which use the energy it obtains to compact the garbage. https://bigbelly.com/
2. Wind powered water pump. https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Wind-Powered-Water-Pump/
